## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Problem of containing all the information of the food item in single entity was overcomed by using structures.
2. Add, update of food items in the food order list of user was done with the help of Linked List Data Structure.
3. For better containtment of project files and easy access of the souce code, multifile approach has been used.
4. Difficulty to run project on command prompt was overcomed by simple use of makefile.
