## Introduction
 COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the hospitality sector. As a result, restaurant managers are paying greater attention to food order management.
Food order management allows restaurants to provide takeout orders or delivery to patrons. Because of COVID-19, food order management has become even more important. With dining rooms closed, takeout and delivery services have become lifelines for many restaurants.
Restaurant managers who are already using food order management systems need a clear idea of what works, what doesn’t, and what they need to improve. And managers without these systems are likely in a rush to find the platform that best fits their needs.
